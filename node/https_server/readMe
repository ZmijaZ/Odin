Description:
template for building express apps the way i see them fit, still needs some extra work (like React, and other links) but so far it's alright

first of:
npm init -y (change the name in package.json from index.js to server.js)
npm install express
//
create server.js and app.js

then, the https stuff:
openssl genrsa -out key.pem
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem (provide the info)
openssl x509 -req -days 9 -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem (should maybe put 9999 days)
//
fill the server.js and app.js with needed code, try it out

later on:
npm install mongoose ejs
